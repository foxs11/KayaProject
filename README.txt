Sammy and Chris phase3

Test-
  Test contains all of our functions. It starts by declaring all of the global
  variables and then declares all of the other functions that we have implemented.
  Test is written but does not compile yet.

UProcInit-
  UProcInit has been fully written and is logically all implemented however has
  not been successfully compiled yet.

TapeRead-
  TapeRead has been fully written and is logically all there yet has not yet been
  able to compile.

DiskOperation-
  DiskOperation has been written yet is not all logically there yet. Still having
  trouble with writing to backing store and where in backing store to write files
  in order to find them later. Along with that, DiskOperation does not compile yet.

Pager-
  Our pager is fully written and should be logically there however it is still 
  a little iffy when it comes to reading and writing from the disk, more specifically
  reading and writing from backing store. The pager does not compile.

Phase3 Sys Handler-
  The phase3 Sys Handler is written and should properly call the correct syscall
  however not all of the syscall's have been implemented. The only one that 
  has been implemented is write to terminal. Phase3 sys Handler does not compile 
  as well.

Where we are with the project as a whole-
  Were we are with the project as a whole is that we have the basic idea of everything
  created and implement or framed out, but we don't have the last very specific
  parts of it implement. The framing of the phase is done and the logical flow of
  the phase has been created but we are still at the part of creating and implementing 
  the very exact and precise parts of the phase. Our phase3 does not compile 
  but has the frame work completed to be able to build it into the rest of the 
  parts of Phase3.
